To use extensions in VLC Media Player on both Mac and Windows, you'll follow a similar process, although the exact steps can vary slightly due to differences in the operating systems' file structures. Extensions for VLC can enhance your experience by adding new features such as internet radio, lyrics display, subtitle downloads, etc. Here's a general guide on how to find, install, and use extensions for VLC Media Player on Mac and Windows:

## 1. Finding VLC Extensions
Official VLC Addons Website: Start by visiting the VLC add-ons website at addons.videolan.org. Here, you can browse through various categories of extensions, skins, and more.
Choose an Extension: Look for an extension that interests you and download it. Extensions usually come in .lua format, but you might also find some that need to be installed differently.
## 2. Installing VLC Extensions
For Windows:
Download the Extension: Save the .lua file to your computer.
Locate the VLC Extensions Folder: Navigate to the following directory:
C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\extensions\
If you installed VLC in a custom directory, navigate there.
Copy the .lua File: Place the downloaded .lua file into the extensions folder.
Restart VLC: If VLC was open during this process, restart it to load the new extension.
For Mac:
Download the Extension: Save the .lua file.
Access the Extensions Directory: Open Finder, press Cmd + Shift + G to open the Go to Folder dialog, and enter:
~/Library/Application Support/org.videolan.vlc/lua/extensions/
If this folder doesn't exist, you might need to create the lua/extensions directories manually within the org.videolan.vlc directory.
Install the Extension: Drag the .lua file into the extensions folder.
Restart VLC: Close and reopen VLC to make the extension available.
## 3. Using VLC Extensions
Open VLC Media Player: Once VLC is open, navigate to the menu bar.
Access Extensions: Look for the "View" menu (Windows) or "VLC" menu (Mac). You should see a list of installed extensions.
Select an Extension: Click on the extension you wish to use. Some extensions will open in a new window, while others might work in the background (e.g., automatic subtitle downloads).
Troubleshooting
Extension Not Showing: Make sure you've placed the .lua file in the correct directory. Restart VLC if you haven't after installation.
Functionality Issues: Some extensions might not work as expected due to updates in VLC or the extension itself. Check the extension's page for updates or support.
Extensions can significantly enhance your VLC experience by adding custom features tailored to your needs. Whether you're on Mac or Windows, the process is straightforward and opens up a lot of possibilities for customizing VLC.
